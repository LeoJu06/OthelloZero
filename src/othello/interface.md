# What Should be displayed on the pygame interface

- current evaluation of the network
- number of games that have been seen (nodes)
- how much moves it has been looked ahead (max depth)
- current score e.g 21 black 43 white 
- win probability graph (dynamicly)
- if enough empty space is there, show which moves have been played
- loading bar indicating the AI's thinking process (using time)
- who has to play



## Neural Network Heatmap
A visual heatmap overlay of the current board that highlights the neural network's evaluation for each possible move. Brighter colors could indicate better moves.
