# OthelloZero

This GitHub repository is the practical part of my baccalaureate thesis. My goal is to implement a kind of AlphaZero algorithm to master the game Othello (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_(Spiel)). 

## How to execute the code:
Simply clone the folder and execute the game.py file in the src/Othello repository. Note that src must be in the Python path. So if you receive an error message, add it.

## Components of the programme: 
I cannot provide this information yet.
